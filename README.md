This project is used to analyze a large set of data having statistics from 1947 and build predictive models to accomplish specific tasks. This involves several key tasks, including predicting if a player will be traded or not, comparing the best team with current teams, analyzing player performance based on position and statistics, predicting if a player will be selected for the All-Star team, estimating the career length of a player based on their rookie season statistics, and
predicting player salary.
